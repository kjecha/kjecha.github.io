Hybridization between species has long been considered an evolutionary “dead-end” as instances of hybridization can result in infertile offspring. However, there are in fact many instances of hybridized animals that produce fertile offspring which can then go on to shape the evolutionary trajectory of the species. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of hybridization and the causes and consequences it can have on species can shed light on this important but understudied driver of diversification.
