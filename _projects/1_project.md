The ability of certain animals to reproduce without the need for a mate calls into question the need for sex in the first place. Investigating how different species have transitioned from sexual to asexual reproduction shines a light on the benefits and consequences of each reproductive mode.  

I am investigating the origin of all-female, parthenogenetic populations of the ladybug *Nephus voeltzkowi*. These populations are triploid, infected with *Wolbachia*, and of hybrid origin, all well-known features of transitions to parthenogenesis in insects. The presence of sexual populations without these characters gives us a unique opportunity to study which of these spurred the transition.
