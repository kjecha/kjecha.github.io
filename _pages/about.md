I am a PhD student at the University of Lausanne in [Tanja Schwander's](https://www.unil.ch/dee/schwander-group) group.  
My thesis focuses on determining the causes and consequences of the transition to parthenogenesis in insects.  

My current projects focus on molecularly identifying species within the [*Lasius*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasius) genus of ants with contaminated RAD-seq data and understanding the origins of parthenogenetic populations of the ladybug [*Nephus voeltzkowi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephus_voeltzkowi).  
   
I enjoy learning and applying new bioinformatics techniques. I have become proficient in analyzing various genetic and genomic datasets.
