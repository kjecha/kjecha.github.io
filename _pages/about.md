I am a PhD student at the University of Lausanne in Pr. Tanja Schwander's group.  
My thesis focuses on the genomic causes and consequences of insect hybridization.  

My current projects focus on molecularly identifying species within the *Lasius* genus of ants with contaminated RAD-seq data and understanding the origins of parthenogenetic populations of the ladybug *Nephus voeltzkowi*.  

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
